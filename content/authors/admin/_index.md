My research background includes working on the design, construction, characterization, and deployment of the world's most advanced stratospheric science instrument, SPIDER. Through this work, I have tackled a wide array of experimental efforts, including challenges related to cryogenics, optics, electronics, rigging, logistics, and software. I designed and built a novel capillary assembly that provides a steady supply of superfluid helium to a 1.8 Kelvin temperature stage in the SPIDER flight cryostat, critical for a successful flight. I am the leading cryogenic expert on SPIDER and I oversaw the successful 2015-deployment of the largest cryostat ever to fly on a stratospheric balloon.
