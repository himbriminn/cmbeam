My research focuses on how to best model beam-related systematics for various experiments. I've modelled how non-ideal behavior of polarisation  modulators impact B-mode searches. I've also simulated scan-synchronous signal for ground and balloon-based experiments. Currently, my work is divided between working on Simons Observatory, LiteBIRD and a balloon-borne experiment called Taurus.
