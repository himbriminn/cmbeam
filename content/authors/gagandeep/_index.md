# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I have worked on spatial mode engineering in periodic photonic bandgap materials such as photonic crystals during my PhD. I am interested in numerical and experimental study of periodic structures, waveguide/cavity based devices designed in such structures for myriad applcations. I am currently working on a prototype of Plasma Haloscope based on wired metamaterials for Axion detection.
