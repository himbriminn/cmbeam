# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
#bio: In the hope to contribute to the current efforts of the Cosmology comunity to unveil the early stages of the Universe and its evolution, I did a PhD. in instrumentation for cosmology applications at Cardiff University, which covers design methods, fabrication and experimental characterisation of a Metamaterial-based Lenslet (MetaL) prototype coupled to an antenna fed detector plane. I then joined the CMBeam group to carry on experimental characterisation and qualification of optics for futur cosmology experiments.
