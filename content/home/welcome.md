_S√≠√∞an er √° ensku en h√¶gt er a√∞ lesa um Skuggsj√° [h√©r](/skuggsja)_ / We work on experiments probing the early universe, the nature of dark matter, and the birth of the first stars. From here you can take a [quick tour](/tour/) of our efforts, read about our [projects](/projects/), or [get in touch](/contact/).

<!-- **We are [recruiting](https://english.hi.is/university/vacancies),** so please contact us if you are looking for jobs in experimental astrophysics! -->

<!-- The primary focus of our research group is to test theories describing the beginning of the universe, the nature of elusive dark matter, and the birth of the first stars. For this purpose, we work on novel aspects of cryogenic and optical instrument design, simulations, and data analysis.  -->

<!-- A key aspect of our research at **the University of Iceland** and **Stockholm University** focuses on optics design, characterization, and technology development for telescopes operating at millimetre wavelengths **and** the development of novel metamaterial resonators. Our primary goal is to advance our understanding of optical systems designed for applications in cosmology. Of particular interest is the study of the cosmic microwave background ‚Äî the oldest light in the universe ‚Äî and the search for dark matter axions. -->
