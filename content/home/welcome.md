to our group site 👋

The primary focus of our research group is to test theories describing the beginning of the universe, the nature of elusive dark matter, and the birth of the first stars. For this purpose, we work on novel aspects of cryogenic and optical instrument design, simulations, and data analysis. 

<!--From here you can take a [quick tour]({{< relref "../tour/" >}}) of our efforts or [get in touch]({{< relref "../contact/" >}}) 🖖 -->

<!-- A key aspect of our research at **the University of Iceland** and **Stockholm University** focuses on optics design, characterization, and technology development for telescopes operating at millimetre wavelengths **and** the development of novel metamaterial resonators. Our primary goal is to advance our understanding of optical systems designed for applications in cosmology. Of particular interest is the study of the cosmic microwave background — the oldest light in the universe — and the search for dark matter axions. -->
