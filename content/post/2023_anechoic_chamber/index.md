We built an anechoic chamber in collaboration with Emerson and Cuming Anechoic Chambers. The chamber measures roughly 2.5 x 2.5 x 7 m and uses Wavesorb VHP-4 absorber tiles. The build process took about a week and was lead by ECAnechoic's engineer, Kris Ceustermans. Kris has been working on installing anechoic chambers around the world for 38 years in 28 countries. This was has last job before retiring! We are very thankful to Kris and ECAnechoic for the nice collaboration.
