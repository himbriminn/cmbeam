title: Beamconv meeting in Munich
date: 2023-07-20

---

We had a mini-workshop in Munich on spherical harmonic convolution codes such as beamconv and totalconvolver. The main goal of the meeting was to understand key differences between existing codes and to coordinate future merging of existing convolution libraries. 

Participants: Alexandre Adler, Adriaan Duivenvoorden, Jon Gudmundsson, Marta Monelli and Martin Reineck.
