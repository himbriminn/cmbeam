Ashesh, Rustam, and Jon visited Milan to participate in the <a href="https://cmbcal24.polocalc.eu">CMBCal conference</a>. There we met up with a bunch of friends as well as alumni from the group, including former PhD students, Adri, Alex, and Nadia. Rustam and Ashesh presented posters at the meeting. Rustam's posters described his and Thomas' work on robot-enabled holography while Ashesh presented on early results on refractor simulations with the Meep FDTD software. It was great to see so many old friends and learn about lots of cool calibration activites. Many thanks to Federico Nati, Gabriele Coppi, and all of the organizers!
