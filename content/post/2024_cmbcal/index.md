Ashesh, Rustam, and Jon visited Milan to participate in the <a href="https://cmbcal24.polocalc.eu">CMBCal conference</a>. There we met up with a bunch of friends as well as alumni from the group, including former PhD students, Adri, Alex, and Nadia. Rustam and Ashesh presented posters at the meeting. It was great to see so many old friends and learn about lots of cool calibration activites.
