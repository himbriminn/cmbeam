Members of the CMBeam team visited Yokohama, Japan, to participate in the SPIE conference. It was wonderful to see old friends and make new ones. The highlight was definitely talking to all the brilliant people at the poster sessions. Also, it turns out that there is a clothing store in Japan called BEAMS!

Here are some photos from the meeting:
