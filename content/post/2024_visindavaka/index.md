Members of the CMBeam team participated in Vísindavaka, an annual public outreach event for young people. Our booth was equipped with a 1.5-m diameter gravity demonstrator, some videos (in Icelandic) on various astrophysics activities at the University of Iceland, displayed a Hoberman sphere and a poster on CMB resarch at the university.
