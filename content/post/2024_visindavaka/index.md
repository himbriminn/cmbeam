Members of the CMBeam team participated in Vísindavaka, an annual public outreach event for young people. Our booth was equipped with a 1.5-m diameter gravity demonstrator, some videos (in Icelandic) on various astrophysics activities at the University of Iceland, a Hoberman sphere, a perpetual motion machine, and a poster summarizing CMB research activities at the university. The gravity demonstrator and perpetual motion machine were definitely the main attractions. 

We went away with lots of ideas on what to demonstrate next year and we will definitely be participating again :)
