We are setting up an infrastructure that enables holographic techniques at millimeter wavelengths. Thomas and Rustam made an amazing video showing some the capabilities of the system, which includes a <a href="https://cmbeam.com/post/2023_kuka/">6-axis robot from Kuka</a>. 

The video shows that the 3-mm waves that are emitted by the system allow us to pear through plastics and reveal a 3D-printed cat in a box :)

Rustam is in the process of writing an SPIE conference proceeding summarizing this work. Stay tuned!
