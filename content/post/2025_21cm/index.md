Gauti Leon Agnarsson completed his BSc project ([link to thesis](thesis.pdf)) with the research group this spring. His project focused on the construction a simple radio antenna to that could detect 21-cm radiation from neutral hydrogen in our galaxy. The project is based on a hilarious paper called *WTH! Wok the Hydrogen: Measurement of Galactice Neutral Hydrogen in Noisy Urban Environment Using Kitchenware* ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15163](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15163))
