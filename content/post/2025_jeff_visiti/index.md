We had the privilege of welcoming Professor Jeffrey Mcmahon to our lab last week. Jeff is a pioneer in microwave optics who has made major contributions to some of the most advanced telescopes on the planet. During his visit, Jeff gave a talk for the public with the title: From Curiosity to the Cosmos: A Tale of Humanity’s Progress. Just before the talk was about to start, strong northern lights turned on above Reykjavik.
