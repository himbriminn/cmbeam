We recently purchased a refracting telescope (TS 100mm f/5.8 Quadruplet Flatfield) with a camera (ASI 183), a filter wheel. All placed on a Skywatcher AZ EQ6 GT mount. One of the goals for this summer is to learn how to use the telescope so that we can eventually use the system as a teaching instrument.

We did a quick test of the system during a departmental barbeque and managed to catch some sun spots :)
