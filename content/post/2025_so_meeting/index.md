Four members of the group attended the Simons Observatory Collaboration meeting in Manchester this July (one remotely). It was a great opportunity to meet old friends and make news ones. Also wonderful to see three group alumni in roles of responsibility within the collaboration. We shared five posters summarizing our research at the meeting.
