Members of the CMBeam team participated in Vísindavaka 2025, an annual public outreach event for young people. This time, our booth was equipped with a 2.4-m diameter gravity demonstrator, some videos (in Icelandic) on various astrophysics activities at the University of Iceland, a Hoberman sphere, a few perpetual motion machines and Stirling engines, diffraction gratings, lasers, and calcite crystals. 

We upgraded our gravity simulator from [last year]({{< relref "/post/2024_visindavaka" >}}), going from 1.5 to 2.4-m diameter and this allowed for a lot of new demonstrations. We were particularly impressed with simulations of solar system formations which we could perform by giving every child 2-3 marbles and having half of the kids throwin clockwise and the other half counter-clockwise. After a bunch of collisions, only a few marbles would remain in orbit and they were typically all going in the same direction :)
