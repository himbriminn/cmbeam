Our research group is engaged in multiple projects:

We are setting up a new research infrastructure at the University of Iceland. This includes development and testing of various coherent microwave sources in the 40-400 GHz frequency range. We also recently installed a custom anechoic chamber ([see post](/post/2023_anechoic_chamber)). Finally, we are working on the design for a custom cryostat that accommdates small to medium-size refractor telescopes and reimaging optics. This hardware infrastructure is being devloped with current and future-generation CMB experiments in mind, including experiments such as the balloon-borne experiment Taurus and the LiteBIRD satellite. These experimental efforts are leading to multiple projects in design and testing of novel optical components.

We are developing algorithms and code libraries for the calibration of the Simons Observatory (SO) which is currently being deployed in the Atacama Desert. Nadia Dachlythra recently wrote a [paper](/post/2023_nadias_paper/) that summarizes our efforts to calibrate the SO Small Aperture Telescopes. We are continung this calibration work from the University of Iceland.

We maintain an advanced beam convolution algorithm called beamconv ([github link](https://github.com/AdriJD/beamconv)). The code has led to multiple publications.

In work funded by the Swedish Space Agency, we are conducting R&D development of metamaterial microwave absorbers. We are using state-of-the art Terahertz laser systems to design materials that absorbe 99.999% of all incoming microwave radiation. As part of this work, we are trying to understand how design features such chemical composition, metamaterial antireflection coatings, etc. impact the integrated reflectivity of our materials.

We are also working on tuneable resonators prototypes for future axion dark matter haloscopes. This is work related to the ALPHA Experiment ([white paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00017)).
